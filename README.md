## 🏁 What Is This?

**F1 Analytics Hub** is a portfolio-grade data science project that pulls official Formula 1 data using the **FastF1** library, stores it in a structured **SQLite** database, serves it through a **FastAPI** REST backend, and visualizes everything in a dark-themed **React** frontend built to feel like an actual F1 broadcast dashboard.

This isn't just a stats table. It's a full data engineering pipeline — from raw telemetry to interactive charts — covering every team and driver from the modern era, with historical lineage support planned.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Source** | FastF1 + Jolpica-F1 API | Official F1 timing & historical data |
| **Data Processing** | Python + Pandas | Clean, transform, and aggregate race data |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Uvicorn | REST API serving all analytics endpoints |
| **Database** | SQLite | Persistent local store for all race & result data |
| **Frontend** | React 18 | Component-based UI with tab navigation |
| **Charts** | Recharts | Interactive bar, pie, and line charts |
| **HTTP Client** | Axios | React ↔ FastAPI communication |

## ⚡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshbs/f1-analytics-hub.git
cd f1-analytics-hub
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux

pip install fastf1 fastapi uvicorn pandas

mkdir cache
python database.py           # Creates f1.db
python seed.py               # Seeds 2024 season (~5 mins)
uvicorn main:app --reload    # Starts API at http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start                    # Opens http://localhost:3000
```

> You need **both terminals running** at the same time — one for the backend, one for the frontend.
